# 0x0D & 0x0E Web Stack Debugging

## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX System Engineering / DevOps curriculum. Its goal is to train students in **debugging web stacks** inside Docker containers. Computers and web servers rarely work perfectly out of the box, and this project teaches how to identify and fix issues.

In this project, you debugged **Apache** and **Nginx** web servers inside Ubuntu Docker containers to make them serve web pages on the correct ports.
